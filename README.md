# Project Objective
I'm modeling the game sticks, which is a game played with two people. Each person starts with one finger up. As players take turns, they hit other players hands, adding what's on their hand to the player's hand they tapped. (i hit my left hand(2) with ur right hand(1), and now you have 3 on your right hand). If a player ever gets 5 or more on their hand, that hand is dead. When the fingers up on both hands are even, a player can evenly distribute fingers to both hands (4 -> 2 and 2). A player wins when both of their opponent's hands are dead.
